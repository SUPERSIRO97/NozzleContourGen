# NozzleContourGen
This repository contains a C++ tool for designing rocket engine nozzles. It generates the nozzle contour based on chamber and throat geometry, Rao optimal angles, and user-defined radii. The tool can compute convergent and divergent sections, including Bézier curves for smooth nozzle transitions, and export the resulting contour data to CSV files.
